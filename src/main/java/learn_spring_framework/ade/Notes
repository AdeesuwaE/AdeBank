Dependency to see actuator: implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator").
The actuator is used to the beans, mappings, metrics e.t.c.
Actuator makes it easy/helps to monitor and manage application.
Add this management.endpoints.web.include=* to the application properties to see more info from the actuator
Only enable things that you want to see for example:management.endpoints.web.include=health, metrics
Commented out actuator in gradle
